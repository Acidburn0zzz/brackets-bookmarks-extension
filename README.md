Brackets Bokmarks Extension
============================

This Extension provides functionality to bookmark lines in [Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets).  

`Navigate > Toggle Bookmark` or press ⇧⌘K (`Ctrl+Shift+K` on Windows)

And recall those bookmarks later

`Navigate > Next Bookmark` or press ⌘P (`Ctrl+P` on Windows)

`Navigate > Previous Bookmark` or press ⇧⌘P (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows)

Bookmarks are serialized and remembered globally. Add bookmarks to a file, close the file, reopen the file. Brackets will restore the bookmarks.

##TODO
1. Localize. I've set this extension up for localization so please contribute pull requests to translate this extension
1. Bookmarks panel. Show the bookmarks in all open documents and recall or delete them.
1. Sync bookmarks if files are changed externally... Use a hash of the line maybe?
